 FYS3150 Projects Fall 2019

 This repository contains the source files for all the projects in FYS3150 in the fall of 2019.
 
 ## Project 1
 This project solves the Poisson equation with the use of a tridiagonal matrix. There is a general and a special algorithm, which is compared to the speed of a LU-Decomposition. To execute algorithms; run fys3150_project1_algorithms.py and follow the user interface in terminal. To see relative error i special algorithm; execute fys3150_project1_relative_error.py

## Project 2
This project solves the Schroedinger's equation for one and two electrons in the harmonic oscillator potential well and finds the eigenvalues of the systems. The algorithm used is the so called Jacobi's rotational algorithm.

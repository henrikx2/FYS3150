FYS3150 Projects Fall 2019
 
This repository contains the source files for all the projects in FYS3150 in the fall of 2019.
 
 ## Project 1
This project solves the Poisson equation with the use of a tridiagonal matrix. There is a general and a special algorithm, which is compared to the speed of a LU-Decomposition. To execute algorithms; run fys3150_project1_algorithms.py and follow the user interface in terminal. To see relative error i special algorithm; execute fys3150_project1_relative_error.py

## Project 2
This project solves the Schroedinger's equation for one and two electrons in the harmonic oscillator potential well and finds the eigenvalues of the systems. The algorithm used is the so called Jacobi's rotational algorithm. 

## Project 3
This report shows how the Monte Carlo integration algorithm is a superior algorithm compared to the Gauss Guadrature integration method in terms of calculating a multi-dimensional integral. The superiority is both in terms of accuracy and calculation speed. The report also discuss how both methods can be sped up and improved in terms of expressing the integrand in a different basis (spherical coordinates) and/or using a suitable Probability Density Function or implementing parallelization. The observations in this report are useful to determine which method to use when facing other integration problems later on.

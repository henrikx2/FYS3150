## Abstract

Key results, why is this work worthwhile? Credibility for my claims.

## 1 Introduction

The ground state corrolation energy between two electrons in a helium atom can be determined by solving a 6-dimensional integral. This integral is derived by modelling the wave function of each electron as an single-particle wave function of the electron in the hydrogen atom. For an electron *i* in the 1s state, the dimensionless and unnormalized single-particle wave function can be expressed as

$$
\psi_{1s}({\bf r}_i) = e^{-\alpha r_{i}}
$$

where $\alpha$ is a parameter, and

$$
{\bf r}_i =  x_i {\bf e}_x + y_i {\bf e}_y +z_i {\bf e}_z
$$

$$
{r}_i = \sqrt{{x}_i^2+{y_i^2}+z_i^2}
$$

The parameter $\alpha=2$ gives the charge of the helium atom ($Z=2$). Further, the wave function of the two 1s electrons are given by

$$
\Psi(r_{1}+r_{2}) = e^{-\alpha (r_{2}+r_{2})}
$$

The integral to solve in this report is the expectation value for the corrolation energy between the two electrons in the helium atom. The corrolation energy depends on the classical Coluomb interactions of the two electrons, and is given by

$$
\langle \frac{1}{|{\bf r}_1-{\bf r_2}|} \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}d{\bf r}_1d{\bf r}_2e^{-2\alpha({r}_1+{r}_2)}\frac{1}{{|\bf r}_1-{\bf r}_2|} \label{eq:1} \tag{1}
$$

This (unnormalized) integral can be solved on closed form to be $5\pi^2/16^2\approx0.19276571$. This can be showed to be correct by ####

## 2 Methods

### 2.1 Gauss Quadrature

Gauss Quadrature is a method that uses orthogonal polynomials with weight functions to estimate integrals and are referenced in [@gaussQuad]. However, the topic is quite extensively to cover for this report and is therefore just explaned in short and otherwise sited.

#### 2.2.1 Gauss-Legendre Quadrature

First off is using the Gaussian Quadrature with Legendre polinomials. These polinomials are defined at the interval $x\in[-1,1]$ with the weight function $W(x)=1$. The integral in Eq. $\eqref{eq:1}$ can be rewritten in terms of $dx_i, dy_i$ and $dz_i$ as

$$
\langle \frac{1}{|{\bf r}_1-{\bf r_2}|} \rangle =
$$

$$
\int\int\int\int\int\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{d{x}_1d{x}_2d{y}_1d{y}_2d{z}_1d{z}_2e^{-2\alpha(\sqrt{(x_1+x_2)^2+(y_1+y_2)^2+(z_1+z_2)^2})}}{\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2}} \label{eq:2} \tag{2}
$$

Now, every variable is defined on the interval $[-\infty,\infty]$, but since infinity cannot be represented exactly from a numerical point of view, it is here necessery to define infinity as a number. This is done to get small enough mesh points, so that the integral becomes more "continous". In this report, the interval $[-2,2]$ should suffice based on Figure 1 underneath

Figure here

The integral to solve with Gauss-Legendre Quadrature is then the integral

$$
\int\int\int\int\int\int_{-2}^{2}\frac{d{x}_1d{x}_2d{y}_1d{y}_2d{z}_1d{z}_2e^{-2\alpha(\sqrt{(x_1+x_2)^2+(y_1+y_2)^2+(z_1+z_2)^2})}}{\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2}} \label{eq:3} \tag{3}
$$

This is solved by the program ###

#### 2.2.2 Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature (Improved Gauss Quadrature)

The Gaussian Quadrature with Laguerre polinomials is defined at the interval $x\in[0,\infty]$ and has the corresponding weight function $W(x)=x^{\alpha}e^{-x}$. By changing to spherical coordinates

$$
d{\bf r}_1d{\bf r}_2  = r_1^2dr_1 r_2^2dr_2 dcos(\theta_1)dcos(\theta_2)d\phi_1d\phi_2
$$

with

$$
\frac{1}{r_{12}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_1^2+r_2^2-2r_1r_2cos(\beta)}}
$$

and

$$
cos(\beta) = cos(\theta_1)cos(\theta_2)+sin(\theta_1)sin(\theta_2)cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)),
$$

it is possible to rewrite the integral with different integration limits ($\theta\in[0,\pi]$ and $\phi\in[0,2\pi]$). This reads

$$
\langle \frac{1}{|{\bf r}_1-{\bf r_2}|} \rangle =
$$
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} r_1^2 dr_1 \int_{0}^{\infty} r_2^2 dr_2 \int_{0}^{\pi} dcos(\theta_1) \int_{0}^{\pi} dcos(\theta_2)\int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi_1 \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi_2 \frac{e^{-2\alpha (r_1+r_2)}}{r_{12}}
$$

where

$$
dcos(\theta_1) = -\sin(\theta_1)d\theta
$$

such that

$$
\langle \frac{1}{|{\bf r}_1-{\bf r_2}|} \rangle =
$$
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} r_1^2 dr_1 \int_{0}^{\infty} r_2^2 dr_2 \int_{0}^{\pi} sin(\theta_1)d\theta \int_{0}^{\pi} sin(\theta_2)d\theta \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi_1 \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\phi_2 \frac{e^{-2\alpha (r_1+r_2)}}{r_{12}} \label{eq:4} \tag{4}
$$

Among these integrals, it is easiest to map $\phi_1, \phi_2, \theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ using Legandre polynomials and $r_1$ and $r_2$ using Laguerre polynomials. This is because $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ and $\phi\in[0,2\pi]$ is easily transformed to $\theta\in[-1,1]$ and $r$ is already defined at the interval $[0,\infty]$.

This integral is solved by the program ###

### 2.2 Monte Carlo Integration

When using Monte Carlo integration, the integration points are defined using a probability distribution. As long as a sufficient number of psudo-random integration points are chosen; this is supposed to make the numerical approximation of the integral have less error. It is the choice of the probability distribution function (PDF) that determines the presicion of the Monte Carlo integration. A thorough explanation of the Monte Carlo methods can found in the lecture notes [@monteCarlo] of FYS3150.

#### 2.2.1 Brute force Monte Carlo Integration

The brute force Monte Carlo integration uses the uniform PDF given by

$$
p(x)=\frac{1}{b-a}\Theta(x-a)\Theta(b-x)
$$

where $\Theta$ is the Heaviside function and which at the interval $[a,b]=[0,1]$ gives the function $p(x)=1$. In the case of Eq. $\eqref{eq:4}$ the interval is not $[0,1]$, but a change of variables such that

$$
z=a+(b-a)x
$$

where $x\in[0,1]$ would make it possible to generate random numbers on the general interval $[a,b]$. In a multidimensional integral the change of variable is expressed

$$
x_i=a_i+(b_i-a_i)t_i
$$

And the Jacobi-determinant given by

$$
‚àè_{i=1}^{d}(b_i-a_i)
$$

where $d$ is the dimension, is also needed.

This integral is solved by the program ###

#### 2.2.2 Improved Monte Carlo Integration

The improved Monte Carlo method introduces two new aspects to improve the results, namely; *change of variable* and *importance sampling*. In general, the change of variable makes $x\rightarrow y$, such that $p(y)$ is a different PDF than $p(x)$ and is chosen depending on how it matches the integrand and its limits.

Importance sampling is
